The admin can manipulate all created Companies, clients and invoices of all users.
The admin also has an overview of all users and can modify the roles.

When creating an invoice, a invoice is generated in a pdf file with the data of the customer and company and the total amount.
This is automatically downloaded into the folder 'wwwroot', where you can find all pdf files that have been created.

The user can only see and manipulate his self-created companies, customers and Invoices.

The user that is sealed is Admin
